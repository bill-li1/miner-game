# Virtual Miner is Here!

Virtual Miner is an Ethereum network betting game that allows you to earn Ethers. Through purchasing and upgrading miners, you can  enter them in betting pools to win prizes!

## How to play:
As an owner, you have to first purchase miners if you want to play. All miners start off with 32MB of storage, but can be upgraded in increments of 32MB up to 1TB. The disk space (capacity) of your miner determines how powerful it is; miners of greater power have higher chances of winning prizes. Once you have purchased at least 1 miner, you can begin entering your miner(s) into pools to win prizes. When a pool reaches its maximum capacity, miners in the pool will be randomly selected as winners:
1. There will be 1 winner who will win 50% of the pooled ether.
2. There will be 3 winners who will win 10% of the pooled ether.
3. There will be 20 winners who will win 1% of the pooled ether.

As mentioned earlier, there are 3 pool sizes. Smaller pool sizes will have smaller prize pools, but will ensure a higher chance if being selected. On the other hand, larger pools have larger prize pools, but the probability of being selected is reduced. The pools are as followed:
- Small Pool *(activates when 100 miners enter)*
- Medium Pool *(activates when 250 miners enter)*
- Large Pool *(activates when 1000 miners enter)*

Chances of winning are based on the number and quality of miners you place into the pool as well as the size of the pool.

## How to win:
There are two methods to increasing your chances at winning the prize.

1. Upgrading your Miners

By upgrading your miner, you increase its disk space, which in turn, increases its chance of winning. However, upgrading your miners will also increase the costs of deploying them into a pool. 

2. Purchasing Additional Miners

By purchasing additional miners, you can place more miners into the pool. Remember that you are rewarded when any one of your miners are selected as winners. Finally, there is a cap on the amount of miners that you can place in a pool:
* 20 miners for the small pool
* 50 miners for the medium pool
* 200 miners for the large pool

   **It is more expensive to put 2 32MB miners than 1 64MB miner. It is beneficial to upgrade your miners.**

3. Costs

There are three actions in the game that requires ethers.
1. Purchasing a new miner (9,656,297,296,172,600.0000 Wei)
2. Upgrading your miner (adding more storage makes it stronger) (10000000000000 Wei)
3. Deploying your miner into the pool. (4,828,148,648,086,300.0000 + 100000000000 \* miner size)

The cost of deploying your miner into the pool will depend on the size of the miner. The more powerful the miner, the more it will cost. Deploying two 32MB miners will provide the same chance of winning as deploying a single 64MB miner, but upgrading miners is much cheaper than purchasing new ones, making it far more beneficial to upgrade miners instead of purchasing new ones. Furthermore, the 20% miner cap also provides incentive to upgrade your miners, as two hundred 1TB miners is much better than two hundred 32MB miners.
